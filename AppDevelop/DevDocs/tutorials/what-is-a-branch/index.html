<h1 style="font-family:verdana">What is a branch</h1>
<p style="font-family:verdana">A branch is a starter code for opening a script. It can be written as <code>branch112 {
/* Your code here
  } end branch112</code>.
An example is if you wanted a simple script like opening a new screen, you need to start with a main branch (<code>branch112{</code>) and add a sub-branch (<code>sub-branch121</code>)
